description: "Hi! I'm Arianna!<br><br>
I'm a Game Developer and Game Designer graduate from <a href='https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.com' target='_blank'>Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>.<br>
While I have mainly worked on puzzle games, I'm also very fond of creating more chill or peculiar games.<br>
I get inspired by the world around me so I try to express how I see it in my games and try to create original concepts or mechanics to show it.<br>
I also try to find an example in indie games and am never afraid to develop more controversial concepts.<br>
My main works are simple prototypes but I got many more ideas on the way!"
